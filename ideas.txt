- pacman
- flappy bird
- pong
- dino animation like chrome
- animation of sun rising and setting over a scene (8 bit style)
- run game animation
- 3 cups animation (ball underneath)


=> Program decomposition
- draw field/backdrop
- draw dots (food) around the grid (not individual turtles)
- create pacman turtle that:
    - moves around the field collecting/eating food (dots will dissapear)
    - changes appearance for open, slighty open, and closed keyframes
- dots reappear after the animation restarts (when pacman enters teleport pad on the right side)

=> Extra features
- ghosts (controlled by user?)
- ending animation (death of pacman crossing a ghost)

=> Steps and milestones
1. create a game field and dots for pacman to navigate through [Wednesday]
2. place dots and create pacman object, and create a path for pacman to run [Thursday]
3. add dots dissapearing behavior when pacman crosses it [Thursday/Friday]
4. animation will restart after crossing into the right side of the screen (teleport pad) [Friday/Monday]
5. add second path to run [Monday/Tuesday]
